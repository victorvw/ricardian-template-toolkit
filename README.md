# EOSIO.CDT Ricardian Template Toolkit ![EOSIO Alpha](https://img.shields.io/badge/EOSIO-Alpha-blue.svg)

This library is a new tool in the suite of tools from [EOSIO.CDT (Contract Development Toolkit)](https://github.com/EOSIO/eosio.cdt/tree/develop), and should allow for a more robust and rich environment for writing **Ricardian** contracts for your **EOSIO** smart contracts.

## Overview

The Ricardian Template Toolkit is an implementation of a renderer for the [Ricardian Contract Specification](https://github.com/EOSIO/ricardian-spec) that demonstrates how Ricardian Contracts built to the specification can be displayed. This toolkit can be used by Authenticator developers to consistently render Ricardian Contracts and by Smart Contract developers as an authoring and testing tool.

Together, the Ricardian Template Toolkit and Ricardian Contract Specification projects enable a clear understanding of the agreements to which users are consenting in Authenticators which ask them to sign transactions.

This library contains a factory that takes an ABI object, a transaction object, and an action index (along with some developer-oriented flags). It then:

1. Selects an appropriate processor based on the `spec_version` field in the contract metadata
1. Validates the Ricardian Contracts and metadata associated with the transaction actions
1. Validates all other spec requirements, including image sizes and hashes
1. Interpolates all variables with data from the transaction or ricardian_clauses
1. On success, returns an object with metadata and Contract Markup Language (CML, a subset of HTML)
1. On error or validation failure, returns a descriptive error, along with any data it was able to successfully parse and render

## Installation

`yarn add ricardian-template-toolkit`

## Command Line Tool

The toolkit includes a simple command line wrapper around the library for local testing of HTML generation. If you install the package globally, the `rc` command will be available on the command line. If running locally, use (within the project root) `./bin/rc`. Given an ABI, transaction data (fully deserialized), and optionally the transaction index (default 0) the `rc` command will output the generated HTML fragment.

Example:
```
rc -a myabi.json -t mytxn.json -i 1
```

The metadata is also available with the `--only-metadata` option.

Example:
```
rc -a myabi.json -t mytxn.json -i 1 --only-metadata
```

Help is available with `rc --help`.

## Running Locally

```
yarn install
yarn build
yarn example
```

## Other Commands

* `yarn lint`
* `yarn test`

## Ricardian Specification

The Ricardian Specification and an example of a compliant Ricardian contract can now be found at https://github.com/EOSIO/ricardian-spec.

## Usage

Usage is very straightforward:

```javascript
import { RicardianContractFactory} from 'ricardian-template-toolkit'

...

// Create the factory instance.
const factory = new RicardianContractFactory()

// Construct a RicardianContractConfig object
const config = {
  abi: myAbi,
  transaction: myTransaction,
  actionIndex: 0,
  // Optional - defaults to 3
  maxPasses: 3,
  // Optional - developer flag - if true ignore errors if a variable
  // is specified in the contract but no value is found to substitute
  allowUnusedVariables: false
}

const ricardianContract = factory.create(config)

const metadata = ricardianContract.getMetadata()
const html = ricardianContract.getHtml()
```

## Backward Compatibility Note

Be aware that for backward compatibility with contract specifications prior to `0.1.0`, any contracts
lacking a `spec_version` in the metadata are treated as following spec version `0.0.0`.

## Example
The following is based on the [example from the Ricardian Contract Specification](https://github.com/EOSIO/ricardian-spec#example-template)
